### üß† Importance of User-Friendly Design in a Booking System

A user-friendly design is critical in a booking system because it directly impacts trust, conversion rates, and user satisfaction. When users can easily browse, understand, and complete their bookings without errors or confusion, they are more likely to follow through and return in the future.

Key benefits include:

- **Reduces friction**: Streamlined flows prevent drop-offs.
- **Builds confidence**: Clear prices, details, and steps reassure users.
- **Enhances accessibility**: Inclusive design ensures all users can interact with the site.
- **Encourages return visits**: A good experience often leads to repeat usage and referrals.

By prioritizing thoughtful UI/UX design, this project aims to deliver a professional, real-world feel that mirrors industry standards.
