# airbnb-clone-project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a clone of the Airbnb website, developed as part of a learning initiative to understand full-stack web development and responsive design. It mimics key features of the original Airbnb platform, such as property listings, search functionality, booking UI, and user interface interactions.

The main goal of this project is to practice building modern, dynamic web applications using real-world design patterns and best practices.
